# Description ðŸ‘ˆ

It's a web application for managing hospitals rooms and determining the patient's priority for isolation. The app provides a centralised hub for managing the patients and planning their distribution across hospitalâ€™s rooms. The times being as they are of a global contagious pandemic, room and equipment management in a hospital is of utmost importance and that is what out Care Hospitals does.

It allows nurses to keep track of the patients and their diseases in real time and to have an overview over the patients and rooms, and better manage the rooms assignment across patients. It also allows the hospital staff to take special measures in case of a Covid-19 patient and to keep check of the things required in hospitals.
